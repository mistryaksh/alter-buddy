                         We employ procedural and technological security
                         measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect
                         your personal information from unauthorized access or
                         disclosure. The Company may use encryption, passwords,
                         and physical security measures to help protect your
                         personal information against unauthorized access and
                         disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100%
                         complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot
                         guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your

                         will not be collected and used by others. You should
                         take steps to protect against unauthorized access to
                         your password, phone, and computer by, among other
                         things, signing off after using a shared computer,

                         can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password
                         private. The Company is not responsible for the

                         stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on

                         Your password is the key to your Account. When creating
                         your password you should use unique numbers, letters,
                         special characters, and combinations thereof. In
                         addition, DO NOT disclose your password to anyone. If
                         you do share your password or your personal information
                         with others, you are solely responsible for all actions
                         taken via your Account. If you lose control of your
                         password, you may lose substantial control over your
                         personal information and be subject to legally binding
                         actions taken on your behalf. Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD

                         IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE COMPANY TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.

                         J. Why We Don't Offer Free Sessions
                    </h6>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 my-3">
                         At Alterbuddy, we believe in the natural balance of
                         energy in the universe, which operates on the principle
                         of exchange. Manifestation and healing are deeply
                         rooted in this balance, and when we receive something
                         valuable, it's important to give something in return.
                         {"\n\n"}
                         Offering free sessions disrupts this flow and can
                         inadvertently deplete the energy of healers, impacting
                         the quality of their guidance and care.
                         {"\n\n"}
                         To honor the energy exchange that supports both our
                         clients and our healers, we kindly ask that you refrain
                         from requesting free consultations.
